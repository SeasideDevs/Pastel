# Contributing Guidelines

Hey there! Thanks for wanting to contribute to Pastel. To keep things rolling smoothly we set out a bunch of guidelines for you to follow while contributing!

## Before you Start

Before you start please [make an issue](https://github.com/SeasideDevs/Pastel/issues/) or join the [support server](https://dsc.gg/sea) informing us about your planned changes/ideas. We don't want you to put in a bunch of work for it to be denied due to something.

## Starting

Once you gotten the go ahead from us you can get started and setup the project on your local machine with these steps!

First, make a fork of the project to your own GitHub account.

Then clone your fork to your local machine with the following command or use a GUI to do it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME-HERE/Pastel.git
```

To install all the dependencies required run the following command:

```bash
npm run install:develop
```

Now just run the following command. And now you're ready to code! Have fun!

```bash
npm run watch:scripts
```

Make sure to commit your changes and push to your fork when you're done! Then open a pull request for it to be reviewed!
