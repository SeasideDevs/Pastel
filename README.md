Pastel is a easy to host global ban list for Discord! You can use this to self host a personal ban list for your servers. Or you can use it to setup a synced ban system for your servers!

# Installation

Installation instructions will be here when the project is at a working state

# How to use?

This repo contains the backend part of Pastel. You can use Pastel as is with the included helper functions to do what the API allows. These functions allow you to manage users on the list, create applications/tokens, and configure your instance without needing to make manual HTTP requests. There is also a planned GUI for carrying out the functions as well. The GUI will support Discord Auth for authenticaion.
